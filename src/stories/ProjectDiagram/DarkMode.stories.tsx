/**
 * Demonstrates the new `mode` and `colors` props introduced in v0.3.0.
 *
 * - `Light` and `Dark` cover the two presets.
 * - `BrandOverride` shows a partial token override applied on top of the
 *   dark preset — useful for host apps that want to snap accents to their
 *   own primary color.
 *
 * Toggle the `mode` control in the toolbar to swap between presets without
 * remounting; zoom and selection state persist across the swap.
